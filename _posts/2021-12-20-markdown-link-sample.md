{{ page.description }}
There are many ways to do links in [Markdown][markdown].
This page uses the form I prefer, which I use consistently.
It is "DRY" (don't repeat yourself), when you want to use the same URL in two or more links in the text.

Notice the several links in this page text.  You can see how they are generated by looking at the [raw source][raw] for this page.

(The vZome design here is one by [John Kostick][original].)
