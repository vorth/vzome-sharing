vZome offers several of these topological equivalents to the snub dodecahedron.
Here are some I haven't seen before.
I discovered them while exploring the
[icosahedral orbits in Observable](https://observablehq.com/@vorth/orbits-of-icosahedral-symmetry).
Orbit cylinders in that visualization turn out to be excellent predictors of
snub dodecahedra constructible with vZome orbits, such as these three.

Download the vZome file for any of these three, open it with the [vZome desktop app](https://www.vzome.com),
and you can use the "undo" command repeatedly to see how I constructed the necessary vertices.
Another way to see this is to visit [vZome Online](https://vzome.com/app) and load the vZome file there;
the command history is actually visible and randomly accessible if you do that.
