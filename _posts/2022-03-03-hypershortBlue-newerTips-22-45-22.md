This is a 3D-printable design for Zometool B00 struts.
At the moment, Zometool produces R00 (red) "hyper-short" struts, but no Y00 or B00 struts.
On [my Shapeways store](http://www.shapeways.com/shops/vzome), I have designs for both available,
but I have had some trouble achieving a good friction fit on the blue tips.
This is my third or fourth attempt.

The design incorporates flexible buttresses that should compress very slightly when entering the
rectangular holes in the Zome connector ball.  Note that I haven't printed any of these with
Shapeways yet, so caveat emptor!

As always, my Shapeways store has no markup for me, so the cost you see is the cost that Shapeways charges.
