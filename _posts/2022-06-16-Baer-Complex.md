An attempt to model Steve Baer's design for the Complex at Drop City,
which cannot be built with rZome.
(None of the white struts exist, and we don't make oranges or purples yet!)
Notice how it's splitting apart in front where the 10-gon arches don't quite fuse.
(This was not a problem for the Droppers: if you can't fuse it, fudge it!)
