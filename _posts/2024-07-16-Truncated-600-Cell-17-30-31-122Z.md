I was invited to lead a large Zome build at [SUMaC](https://spcs.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-university-mathematics-camp-sumac) this past Sunday.
I gave the campers three options, each of which was expected to make use of most of the available Zometool parts.
They selected the partial truncated 600-cell, a 3D projection of a 4D polytope.

The build was completed in two hours, a remarkable feat considering that most of the team were Zometool novices.
Most of this can be attributed to the fact that all of these students are very sharp.
I also prepared interactive 3D build instructions, seen below, and printed QR codes for them to scan.
Mobile phones and tablets were put to good use, and they could largely self-direct to assemble the model.

We did have one hitch.  When I designed this model, I failed to notice that the bottom was actually in two layers!
The students detected this almost immediately, and I had to scramble to identify what we needed.
The result was some triangular "feet" added at a few spots, which you can see in the
(now somewhat inconsistent) build steps above.
We got this wrong, initially, but corrected it quickly.
