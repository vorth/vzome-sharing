The [truncated 120-cell](https://github.com/vorth/vzome-sharing/tree/main/2022/07/30/20-36-35-red-stretch-H4-1100/) is one
of the nicest of the 15 uniform 4-D polytopes having the symmetries of the 120-cell and 600-cell.
This one has been projected *obliquely*, to a 3-D subspace that is not orthogonal to the projection direction,
making it appear slightly stretched out.

    The polytope projection is stretched out because of the oblique projection to 3-D.

The stretching is just right to produce red, blue, green, orange, and purple struts.
The last two strut colors (signifying particular orbits in icosahedral symmetry) don't exist in real [Zometool](https://zometool.com).
