When we use [Zometool](https://zometool.com) to construct 3-D projections of 4-D polytopes,
we almost always find places where the projected edges intersect.
This is only an artifact of the projection, of course.
Since we want the Zome balls to represent actual vertices of the 4-D polytope,
we don't want to use them for these intersections, which are NOT vertices at all.

This design is meant to be 3-D printed in color, to be used where red and yellow
struts intersect in the [Triality](https://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/zometriality.htm) projection of the 24-cell, shown below.
