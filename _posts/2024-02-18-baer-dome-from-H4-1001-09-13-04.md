        <p>
          In the mid-1960s, Steve Baer was living in Drop City, an artist's community outside of Trinidad, Colorado.
          Baer was very interested in dome structures,
          but was frustrated with some of the features of geodesic domes popularized by Buckminster Fuller.  
          Baer wanted something more adaptable, extensible, and modular, 
          so he explored the geometry of zonohedra, polyhedra with rings of parallel edges. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Through his studies, Baer became intimately familiar with the Platonic and Archimedean solids.  
          At Drop City, Baer and others built a variety of dome buildings "on the cheap", 
          salvaging car tops for the panels in the domes.  
          The most iconic of these was 
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="dropcity" >Baer's triple dome</span>, 
          constructed with parts of
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="juncture" >three rhombicosidodecahedra fused together</span>.
          For brevity, I'll use "RID" instead of 
            "<span class="trigger" data-figure="RID" >rhombicosidodecahedron</span>"
          (or "RIDs" plural) in the rest of this article. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Most of the figures in this article are interactive 3D views.  Use your mouse or touch to rotate, pan, and zoom.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          To construct his triple dome, Baer had to overcome a slight problem:
          when he tried to fit the three RIDs around a point, they didn't connect.
          The construction requires chopping off two caps from each polyhedron, exposing
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="module" >partial decagon faces</span>.
          The problem is that the angle between those faces is not 2ùúã/3,
          required if they are to all meet around a point.
          You can try to build
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="gap" >three such modules in Zometool</span>,
          but they won't join up with normal Zome balls 
          -- you would need two kinds of special connectors at the boundary, 
          and you're still left with an angular gap.
          Baer had to "fudge" it, using force to close the slight gap the third joint.
        </p>

        <h3>The 4D Approach</h3>

        <p>
          In four dimensions, where the three RIDs can each be in their own 3D space (hyperplane),
          they join seamlessly if those three hyperplanes are at the appropriate angles.
          In fact, there is a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runcinated_120-cell" target="_blank">uniform 4D polytope</a>
          that has exactly this configuration.
          This polytope contains
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="basic-cells">dodecahedral cells</span>
          (seen here in a cutaway view for clarity)
          that are separated by prisms and tetrahedra.
          This effectively wraps the dodecahedra in
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="overlap-rids">overlapping RIDs</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are seeing the usual
            <a href="https://zometool.com" target="_blank">Zometool</a>
          projection from 4D to 3D, so any cluster of RIDs we see here can be built with Zometool,
          or with an equivalent system scaled up for architectural use.
          To replicate the three-fold symmetry of Baer's triple dome,
          we can use a
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="triple">triple RID cluster</span>
          as seen here.
          Let's discard the rest of the 4D polytope for a
          <span class="trigger" data-figure="isolated">clearer view</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of simplicity of construction, this approach looks quite favorable at first glance.
          There are only three kinds of struts needed, and only seven kinds of panel.
          However, things get a little more subtle when we try to define a
          <span class="trigger" data-figure="bad-floor">floor plane</span>.
          The symmetries of our squashed RIDs do not provide a natural place to introduce
          the floor.
          Any choice we make will require very non-standard struts and panels where our structure meets the floor.
        </p>

        <h3>More Symmetry</h3>

        <p>
          How can we mitigate this problem?
          One way is to choose another projection from 4D to 3D, one that naturally
          produces a more symmetric cluster of three RID cells.
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="dodec-cells">This projection</span>
          (again shown in cutaway view)
          is the most symmetric one possible,
          with the dodecahedral cells symmetrically arranged around a central three-fold axis.
          This is still the same 4D polytope, so we get our
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="triple-rid">cluster of three RIDs</span>
          as before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this projection has a central plane of mirror symmetry,
          it is easy to find a good candidate for the
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="good-floor">floor plane</span>,
          with only six struts actually <em>intersecting</em> the floor plan rather than ending at it. The
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="final-design">final design</span>
          Needs only some half-length yellow struts, and even the central pole (and downspout!)
          length is easy to construct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we are paying a price for this symmetry.
          Our parts inventory has ballooned, with seven kinds of struts and at least nine kinds of panels!
          Furthermore, this design really calls for strut connectors that have three-fold prismatic symmetry,
          rather than full icosahedral symmetry like Zometool balls,
          if we want to simplify our strut designs.
        </p>

        <h3>A Compromise Solution</h3>

        <p>
          We can get back to the comfortable and familiar territory of Zometool parts,
          while still having a simple floor design,
          if we reconsider the 
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="regular-plus-two">original projection</span>
          and give up on three-fold rotational symmetry.
          By selecting the 
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="asymm-cluster">central RID and two neighbors</span>,
          we once again have a mirror plane that slices exactly through the center of the cluster.
          Now we can
            <span class="trigger" data-figure="asymm-final">place our floor</span>
          in a natural way, without introducing anything more exotic that a half-blue strut.
          Our parts inventory is otherwise back to just three Zometool struts and the familiar
          Zomeball connector,
          although we now require 10 different panel shapes due to the asymmetry.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
          As with anything else, perfection turns out to be elusive,
          and tradeoffs are always required.
          Nonetheless, we have at least found three ways to construct variations on
          Baer's triple dome without compromising on exact positions.
