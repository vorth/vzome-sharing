<h2>Projections of the Grand Antiprism</h2>
<br/>

<p>
Today I learned of the <a href="http://cs.stmarys.ca/~dawson/images3.html">grand antiprism</a>, a unique four-dimensional polytope discovered by Conway and Guy.
 <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/hedrondude/antiprisms.html" >Jonathan Bowers</a> gives more information about it.  Since its vertices are 100 of the 120 vertices of the 600-cell, it certainly
seemed to be possible to model the grand antiprism in <a href="http://www.zometool.com">Zome</a> and
<a href="/zome">vZome</a>.  As you can see from the images on this page, this turns out to be true.
</p>

<p><a href="https://polytopologist.github.io/zome_pages/">David Richter</a> gave me the hint I needed to construct the object in Zome.  He explained that
one way to "symmetrically" remove 20 of the 120 vertices of the 600-cell was to find the projections of two
orthogonal decagons, and remove the balls and struts comprising those decagons and all attached struts.
The usual Zome model of the 600-cell
exhibits some obvious blue decagons as "equators", and each equator has an orthogonal red "polar axis"
that turns out to be the other decagon, projected down to a line segment.
Using "H_4 1",  shift-select, and "select neighbors" in vZome, it was trivial to produce this model.

Building the object with Zome is fun and instructive, but you must keep in mind that this is only one of the
infinitely many possible projections of the grand antiprism to three-dimensional space.  Let's call it the "Zome
projection".  It could readily be described as the "most symmetric" projection of this object, since each of the
interior cells (like the central blue pentagonal antiprism) actually represents the projections of two distinct
cells in the four-dimensional polytope, overlaid to coincidence in three dimensions.
This projection also clearly exhibits
the three-dimensional symmetry group of the pentagonal antiprism.
</p>

<p>
The Zome projection shows one of the cycles of pentagonal antiprism cells in its columnar interior (with the
coincidence hiding the fact that there are 10 antiprisms).  But where is the "orthogonal" cycle of antiprisms
mentioned by <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/hedrondude/antiprisms.html">Bowers</a>?  Flattened around the "equator"
of the model, so all you see is the triangular sides of the antiprisms; the pentagons are projected down to
red lines, two struts and three balls.
</p>

<p>
There is another projection that is shows one cycle of antiprisms as a central column, but does not exhibit the
coincidence of the Zome projection.  This projection, accomplished in vZome by using a red strut
as a symmetry axis before creating the initial 600-cell, is shown below.  You would call this the
"face first" projection of the grand antiprism, since two pentagonal faces lie in the very center of the model;
the Zome projection is a "cell first" projection.

<p>
In this projection, you can see all ten of the central column of pentagonal antiprisms.  As in the Zome
projection, the equatorial ring of pentagons is projected down to red lines, but with a different orientation,
so that none of the five vertices of the pentagons are coincident.  Note, of course, that most of the struts
in this model are not real Zome struts... only the red struts and the perpendicular blue struts are.
Because the coincidence (2-to-1 overlaying) is gone, this projection displays roughly twice the number of struts as the Zome
projection, and has the symmetry of a decagonal prism rather than a pentagonal antiprism.

<p>
(I should note that all of the projections shown on this page were manually derived from the related
600-cell projection, always by identifying two orthogonal decagons and removing them and any incident
struts.  In the two projections we have seen thus far, identifying those orthogonal decagons was
trivial; in the subsequent projections, there was more guessing involved, but the results seem to be
pretty obviously correct.  The cycles of pentagons are almost completely disjoint, as they are
in the four-dimensional object, though occasionally the projection collapses a separating edge
down to a point.  Nonetheless, you should bear in mind that my "reverse-engineered
projections" have not been rigorously proven to be faithful projections of the grand antiprism.)
</p>


<p>
Is there a projection that shows more clearly both of the orthogonal chains of pentagonal antiprisms at once?  Yes, there are many.
Two are easy to achieve with vZome.  The first is a "green strut" projection, and uses only an octahedral subset
of the blue, yellow, and green zones from real Zome.
</p>

<p>
In this projection, I have added panels to show the pentagonal faces of both antiprism cycles, which would
be very hard to pick out otherwise.  This projection has no axis of prismatic or antiprismatic symmetry,
so does not lend itself to animation.  However, it is very instructive to view it in vZome in a parallel ("perspective" off) projection, particularly with direction "snap" on.  Snapping to a particular red axis gives you
the view below:

<p>
Even if you select a particular projection direction (like the green or red strut), there are still a variety
of different projections of the grand antiprism available in each case, depending on the orientation of the projection
hyperplane with respect to the symmetry axes of the grand antiprism itself.  This brings up an interesting question:
does the original Zome projection allow any other possibilities, for example where neither ring of pentagons is
projected down to line segments?  I suspect it does not.  Can anyone prove this?  Or generate some other projection that has interesting properties?
