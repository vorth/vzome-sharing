  An RT made of special Zome-inspired meta-parts, using near-snub dodecahedra as connectors, 
  allowing plain pentagonal prisms for the struts.

The connector design uses a well-known vZome approximation for a snub dodecahedron.
It is only an approximation because all the triangles are not equilateral;
an exact snub dodec can be built in vZome, but only by using a special field.

The interesting thing about this particular shapes is the orange pentagons,
which are perfectly aligned on both sides of the ball.
This means that two balls can be connected with a pentagonal prism
perfectly lined up with the ball centers.
This is in contrast to normal red struts in Zometool,
which must contain a "twist" in the form of a pentagonal antiprism,
since the opposite pentagons on a Zome ball are *not* aligned.

If you use your right mouse button to pan the view, you can look right down the line of
one of the pentagonal struts, and see right through the strut and both balls.
