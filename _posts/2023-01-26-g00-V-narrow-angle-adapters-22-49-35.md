Here are some designs for 3D-printable adapters to simulate different combinations of
  red and green Zome struts sharing a pentagonal hole in the Zome ball.
They must be printed using a good laser-sintering (SLS) printer, and results will be
very disappointing on a consumer-grade extrusion printer.

## Two G00 Struts

There are two possibilities for two green struts to share a pentagon hole, a narrow angle and a wider angle.

The adapter itself acts like two G00 struts and attached Zome balls.  Adding a G0 strut (as depicted) on each arm
of the V shape yields effectively two G1 struts sharing a single hole.  Select the "use-case" scene above to see this.

You can download the [STL file](https://vorth.github.io/vzome-sharing/2023/05/31/15-16-37-g00-V-narrow-angle-adapter/g00-V-narrow-angle-adapter.stl),
and you can order the part from my [Shapeways store](http://shpws.me/TuUc).

### Printing Costs

My policy on Shapeways is to never add a markup to any design I share; the costs you bear are only what
Shapeways charges, with no profit to me at all.

To keep your costs down, I would normally design a set of several such parts joined together by "sprues",
to align with Shapeways' pricing algorithms.  However, designing those joined collections is quite time-consuming,
and furthermore it is challenging to achieve various dimensional constraints imposed by Shapeways, e.g. minimum "wire diameter".
I opted to invest the time in more strut combinations, instead.  You are free to adapt any of these vZome designs on your own.
Here is the 2G00 design from above, in a ganged configuration.  You can download the
[STL file](https://vorth.github.io/vzome-sharing/2023/01/26/22-49-35-g00-V-narrow-angle-adapters/g00-V-narrow-angle-adapters.stl),
but be warned that the wires are too fine for Shapeways as things stand,
so you'll need to modify the original vZome design and regenerate it, or modify the STL directly
in some other CAD tool.
