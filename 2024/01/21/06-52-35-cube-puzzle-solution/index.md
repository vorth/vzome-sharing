Three simple, identical pieces can be assembled to form a cube shape.  This delightful puzzle is in the Goldilocks zone, "just right"...
tricky enough to challenge even experts, yet still easy enough for novice solvers.  It can even be solved by accident!

<h3>Background</h3>

This puzzle was designed by Yasuhiro Hashimoto, and submitted to the Puzzle Design Competition for the 2013 International Puzzle Party,
where it was among the top 10 vote-getters for the Puzzlers' Award.

It seems very simple, but turns out to be quite challenging to solve.
Many very good puzzle solvers take a long time to solve it, while some neophytes solve it quickly.
We think it is among the best 3-piece puzzles weâ€™ve ever seen!

<h3>Hints</h3>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    What makes this puzzle so challenging?
  </p>
  <p>
    Spoiler alert: don't reveal the analysis until you've solved the puzzle!
  </p>

  <button id="show-analysis">Show Analysis</button>
  
  <div>
    <div id="analysis" class="instruction hidden">
      <p>
      The puzzle seems to play on our tendencies and assumptions, as indicated by some of the hints above.
      </p>
      <p>
      First, most people tend to put the L-shape down on the table, thinking that it defines one face of the cube.
      This could even be based on a heuristic, an instinct to "define the edges first", or "stay out of the center to
      have more room for the other pieces".
      </p>
      <p>
      Second, most people can easily see the 4-fold and even 2-fold symmetries of a cube, but the 3-fold symmetry
      around the central diagonal is harder to visualize, and physically more awkward to examine and manipulate.
