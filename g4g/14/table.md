  Orange and purple struts are natural extensions to the Zometool system.
  This is one of many interesting designs they allow.

{{ page.description }}
The polyhedron is defined by selecting alternating vertices of the great rhombicosidodecahedron,
and connecting nearest neighbors.
The result has the topology of a snub dodecahedron, but fails to have the
uniform edge lengths of that Archimedean solid.
In this exercise, we are leaving out thirty green HG1 Zometool struts,
as they tend to fit too tightly into the Zome ball.

This design is very modular, as you'll see, and well suited to building with a group of people.
This document assumes that there are four teams collaborating to build the final design,
each team contributing one fourth.

The first step is to build "lollipops" using orange struts.
The orange struts fit only into the triangular holes in the Zome ball.
There is no way to do this incorrectly, though you can see that an orange strut
can go into each triangular hole at three different angles.
Each of the four teams needs to build 15 lollipops.

Notice that each orange strut has a rectangular cross-section,
and the wider faces of the strut body lie in a "red plane" --
a plane at right angles to a red strut.
You'll see this easily if you lay the lollipop on the edge of a table
with the Zome ball hanging off the edge;
there will be a pentagonal hole pointing straight up from the
plane of the table.

Now, you will assemble five lollipops to make a regular pentagon.
Here you can see how two lollipops join together.

You may find that your pentagon wants to form a helix,
even though your orange struts all have the flat side up
and are correctly connected together.
The 3D printing process has some inaccuracies, so the tips
of the struts may introduce a slight twist.
Go ahead and connect the pentagon with gentle force.
