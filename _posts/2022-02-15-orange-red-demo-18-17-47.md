Here is a straight-up copy-paste of a discussion from the [vZome Discord server](https://discord.gg/vhyFsNAFPS):

I recently had a conversation with @Jackpike in which he was trying to wrap his head around the way vZome describes strut lengths, specifically the lengths of struts of different colors (orbits). After a while I realized that we were in a PM, not on a vZome channel so I'm going to copy some key points from that discussion here so others can benefit and comment. Some of the intermediate comments and context may be missing, so the basis for some of these comments may not be clear. In this thread, we were generally speaking of the golden field. The concepts apply to other fields but the examples may not. 

It started with this question: I am  still trying to get my head around strut lengths in the different directions particulary blue and yellow. Why is a strut that is 3/5 +4/5 phi in both directions, 4.84 inches in the yellow direction and 5.58 inches in the blue?
I replied: Consider the golden field with octahedral symmetry. The blue directions are edges of a cube parallel to the X,Y and Z axes, so their lengths are multiples of a + bφ (where a and b are both rational numbers) by definition. The yellow directions on the other hand, are on the long (internal) diagonal of a cube so their lengths are necessarily multiples of √3. Their direction vector is always some permutation of (±1, ±1, ±1) scaled by a + bφ. In vZome, we refer to their length only by their color and the scaling factor in the form a + bφ. 

In other words, a blue strut length and a yellow strut length are always related by some scaling of √3 regardless of the field we use. That's an inescapable outcome of blue being on the cube's edge and yellow being on the cube's long diagonal. However, in the golden field, there is no way to scale a "blue unit" by a + bφ which will result in a "yellow unit". In other words, there is no rational multiple of a + bφ which equals √3. 

In fact, there are very few directions (colors) which have unit lengths that are scaled multiples of one another in the golden field.
In the icosahedral system, red and orange have the same unit length, as do yellow and purple, and blue and black.
This arises from the way these vZome orbits are defined in relation to the Zome orbits, as illustrated here for red and orange:

In contrast, if we're working in the √3 field instead of the golden field, then blue lengths will be multiples of a + b√3, so a blue and a yellow can both be the same actual length in that field. Similarly, in the √2 field, the blue lengths will be multiples of a + b√2, so a blue and a green can both be the same actual length since the green direction is on the short (face) diagonal of a cube. 

Maybe another way to think about it is to realize that each "color" represents not only a different direction, but importantly, and perhaps less obviously, a different irrational unit of length. Furthemore, there is generally not a rational factor in a partcular field that will scale one "color unit" to a different "color unit". One blue unit does not equal one yellow unit or one red unit. You could consider that blue struts are measured in units called bluelengths and yellow struts are measured in different units called yellowlengths and reds are measured in yet another different unit called redlengths and each unit is generally an unrelated irrational multiple of all the other color units in that field. I say that there are generally no ways to scale between different color units, but depending on the field and direction, sometimes you can scale between them, and understanding those relationships is key to deciding what field to use for a model.
@Jackpike replied: So If I now make a cube 2 bluelengths for each side it would have co-ordinates ( (±1, ±1, ±1) the yellow long half diagonal  is √3 bluelengths long and the sides of the cube are 2 bluelengths long which is specified in properties as 2 "orbit" units long.  Does this mean 2 yellow units?  (So full diagonal is now 2√3 bluelengths long)

I replied: I think you've nearly got it figured out. Sounds like you just need clarity on the term orbit unit. An orbit unit is not a standard unit of length that applies to all struts like an inch or a millimeter does. It is specifically and intentionally different for each strut direction (color). Orbit unit is the general term for any bluelength, yellowlength, redlength, etc... A blue strut, will always have an actual length of bluelength * (a + bφ). The actual length of a yellow strut, will always be some multiple of yellowlength * (a + bφ), and so on. This allows all strut lengths in the golden field to be mathematically manipulated and described as a + bφ because the out-of-field irrational values like √2 and √3 are built in to the greenlength and yellowlength multipliers. 
As a side note, vZome doesn't generally use the actual strut lengths internally. Lengths are just shown for humans. vZome uses the 3D vector coordinates of both ends of the strut which can always be represented completely within the chosen field (e.g. golden uses a + bφ).

You've probably noticed that zometool strut lengths behave similarly. For example, the B0, B1, B2 struts are progressively longer by multiples of φ, The same is true of Y0, Y1, Y2, but you'll never get any combination of blue struts to be exactly the same length as any combination of yellows or any other strut color.
Then, a slight change of subject let to this: 

Using the built-in scale tools will scale end point coordinates up or down by φ, so the resulting coordinates will always remain in the form a + bφ. 

A number in the golden field is any number of the form a + bφ where a and b are both rationals. This means the integers are just a subset of the golden numbers where the a coefficient is an integer and the b coefficient is zero. That's why, when you multiply it by φ with the scaling tools, the new lengths all have a equal to zero and b becomes an integer coefficient. 

So yes,  (±1, ±1, ±1) is a golden number, or more precisely, it is a set of vectors with coordinates that are all within the golden field.
