[This shirt](https://www.neatoshop.com/product/omnitruncated-5-cell-2)
introduced me to John Kostick, perhaps the most prolific vZome user to date.
I haven't worn it in a few years, though it always makes me smile for this reason.

I was at the 13th Gathering for Gardner conference in 2017, when a woman noticed
the shirt and said,
"Is that Zome?"
I said, "Kind of," and briefly explained about my software.
She said, "You need to meet my husband."
The woman was Jane Kostick, and she soon introduced me to John.
I brought along David Hall, my collaborator, and that was the beginning of
a great friendship and another great collaboration.
David and I worked to add features to vZome for John, and he proceeded to
produce many hundreds of vZome designs.

I didn't realize how many until last year when he started publishing them using vZome's then-new
website sharing feature.  You can [see the result for yourself](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/),
and that's not nearly all of them!

Jane, it must be noted, is a perfect partner to John, since she's a master woodworker,
and together they have created some beautiful and
treasured [puzzles and other works of art](http://www.kosticks.com/).

The Kostick-catcher, as I now think of it, is an orthogonal projection of the
[omnitruncated 5-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runcinated_5-cell#Omnitruncated_5-cell),
a 4-D polytope, projected to 3-D and then 2-D in the most symmetric way possible.
I discovered this [projection into Zome in 2007](https://www.vzome.com/app/fivecell/),
after working with David Richter on the general idea of ["ghost" symmetry](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2006/bridges2006-429.pdf).
