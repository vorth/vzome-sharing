## Your vZome design is uploaded

### [Dedicated page][page]

***This is the best link to share***!  The link is *embeddable* because it will render in social media (e.g. Discord, Twitter, FaceBook...) with a proper title and a preview image.  It is also *design-specific*, so you can customize the [source file][source].  NOTE: make sure you try the link before sharing!  It takes time
for the GitHub Page to get rebuilt.  (I am assuming you have GitHub Pages enabled for this repo!)

### [vZome Online view][embed]

This is the old way to share.  The link is also embeddable, but only by virtue of a hack on the vzome.com server.  The good thing is that this link
can be shared immediately.

### [Raw vZome file][raw]

This is just the link to the raw vZome file, and is **not** good for
sharing on social media.
Honestly, you probably don't want this, though it could be used from either
vZome desktop ("Open URL...") or vZome Online ("Remote vZome URL").
