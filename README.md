## About this repository

This repository is used by vZome to share my designs, when I use the "share" button.
vZome requires this exact repository name, `vzome-sharing`, but does not create the repository automatically, however.

See the [main page][page] for how to set up GitHub and Github Pages to share from vZome.

Here is a [test page][test] I am working on, to work out exactly what vZome should generate.  Here is
[the source][source] for that page.
