I found this design while experimenting with my new orange struts in vZome in 2006.
It is very appealing, as an all-orange construction, possibly modeling a kind of Buckminsterfullerene
with 140 carbon atoms.

In 2014 Stan Schein and James Gayed published their
groundbreaking paper on [Goldberg polyhedra](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1310939111).
At first I thought my orange polyhedron fit the bill, and I even sent them the design,
congratulating them on their discoveries.
Stan and James had been using vZome since 2012, and we had corresponded a bit,
though I don't think vZome was specifically useful for their modeling needs.

In their notion of Goldberg polyhedra, there are several important criteria.
The first is *equilaterality*, having all edges the same length.
This criterion is clearly met by my orange design, being constructed from a single size of orange strut.
The second important criterion, however, is **not** met, that of *convexity*.
An equivalent (I think) way to state this is that the polygon faces must be planar.
A simple application of vZome's "convex hull 3d" tool confirms that my design
does not have planar faces:
