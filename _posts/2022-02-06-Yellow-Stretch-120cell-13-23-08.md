{{ page.description }}

The 120-cell is a 4-dimensional polytope, containing regular 3-D dodecahedral cells, arranged three around
an edge and four around a vertex.  In our 3-D world, we cannot do that with regular dodecahedra, but it is
possible in 4-D mathematical space.

We cannot see 4-D objects unless we make a 3-D "shadow", as if a light source in the 4-D world shone through the
objects onto a 3-D hyperplane, analogous to how shadows in our 3-D world are cast onto 2-D planes.
If the light source is very far away (like our sun), we get a *parallel* projection, with no foreshortening
since there is no useful notion of "nearer to" or "farther from" the light source.
If the projection plane (or hyperplane, in this case) is at right angles to the direction to the light source,
we get an *orthogonal* projection.  If we tilt the projection plane a bit, we get an *oblique* projection,
like your elongated or shortened shadow on a sidewalk whenever the sun is not directly overhead.
(Fun thought experiment: when is your shadow the same length as your height?)

This design is just that, an *oblique parallel* projection of the regular 120-cell into 3-D space.
The angle of projection is very particular, and it yields an object that has been stretched out
along a yellow Zome strut line.
This is a nice projection because it is *almost* constructible with regular [Zometool][zome] pieces --
blue, green, and yellow struts are all real.  The orange struts, however, are only available as 3-D printed
parts available from [Shapeways][shapeways].  These orange struts are commonly seen in
[vZome](https://vzome.com).

The projection is essentially defined such that the final object still has regular dodecahedra made from
blue Zome struts... just not in the center, as you'd normally see with the usual Zome projection of the 120-cell.
