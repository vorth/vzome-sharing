  What would Zometool look like if the connectors were snub dodecahedra?

Something like this.  These are not perfectly regular snub dodecahedra, but they are still special:
their opposite pentagonal holes are exactly aligned, so that the struts can be perfect pentagonal prisms,
with no "twist".  The same is true of the yellow-axis triangular holes.

Notice that you can see right down through the pentagonal holes, all the way through the hollow red struts.
