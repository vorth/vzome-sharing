## Your vZome design is uploaded

### [Quick vZome Online view][quick]

Use this link only if you're in a hurry, and you don't care about link embedding with a preview image.  If you can see this page, then the link will work immediately.

---

### [Raw vZome file][raw]

This is just the link to the raw vZome file, and is **not** good for
sharing on social media.
It is not good for downloading, either.
Honestly, you probably don't want this, though it could be used from either
vZome desktop ("Open URL...") or vZome Online ("Remote vZome URL").

---

### [Download-friendly raw vZome file][rawPages]

This link is slightly better for direct downloading.
However, like the embeddable vZome Online link, it won't be ready until
GitHub Pages has refreshed after your upload.
It will also work in vZome desktop and vZome Online.

---

### [Github source folder][source]

Use this to navigate to the folder in your `vzome-sharing` GitHub repository
that contains your uploaded vZome file, as well as this README.

---

### [Github Pages version][pages]

This README file will also be served by GitHub Pages (after it refreshes),
so you can use this link to view the same content there.
If you want to replace this README with a proper description of your shared model,
this is how you would share that web page.
