On December 14, 2019, we hosted the Bay Area Arts & Math ("BAAM!") group at our house.  As part of the fun,
we did a group construction of the 
[vertex-first projection of the 120-cell](https://vorth.github.io/vzome-sharing/2005/08/25/vertex-first-hyperdo.html)
using Zometool and my own 3d-printed custom struts.

We didn't get it finished in time, since the custom struts often have a loose fit.  They are my own design,
created using [vZome](https://vzome.com) and printed at [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/vzome?section=struts&s=0).
Jacob Rus suggested a nice innovation, using strips of parchment paper wherever we had a loose-fitting strut.
I completed the build the next day.

I had owned the custom struts (olive, maroon, and lavender) for almost ten years.
I first printed them in 2010, and in October of that year my son and I created the (first ever?)
physical realization of the vertex-first projection.

We didn't have much space in that house, so it just stayed on the coffee table for a while,
finding use as a backdrop for photos:

The revived instantiation is now permanently installed in our family room.
